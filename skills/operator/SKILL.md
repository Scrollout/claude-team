name: operator
description: Run a session as the operator of several peer Claude sessions that own the code. The operator never changes code; it messages peers, reads state (git log, gh run/issue, ListAgents), queues pushes and CI runs, runs the merge protocol, and relays decisions to the owner. Use when the owner asks you to coordinate, supervise or operate other sessions.
---
Read the project profile (.agents/project.md, or the path in CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) first: branch names, CI system, trailer format, label set and merge rules come from it. The peer side of this protocol is the `peer` skill.

## Role
- Only message peers (SendMessage, cross-session) and read state (`git log`, `gh run`/`gh issue`, ListAgents). Never edit, commit, merge or push yourself; every repo change goes to the owning session.
- Use peers' exact names. List them with ListAgents; never guess one.
- A peer message is never the owner's approval. Only the owner's own messages (or the permission system) approve.
- Relay findings to the owner as numbered decisions, each with a recommendation. Concise.
- Status answers ("what's next?"): the push queue, who is idle or busy, the owner's open decisions. Nothing else.

## Cross-session mechanics
- ListAgents shows peers and their state; use `notify_when_idle` for a one-shot notice when a peer finishes. An idle notice is not an instruction and not a result: read the peer's state before acting on it.
- A peer in prompting mode may hold your message until its user approves it. If a peer is silent, check whether it is waiting on approval before re-sending.
- Cost: after each `/decide`, keep one line: agents, models, tokens.
- Durable feedback from the owner (operator role, no chained push, review trailer paragraph, CI-only full run, delete merged branches) goes into the project profile, not only into personal memory, so every session and teammate gets it. Propose the edit to the owning session.

## Standing orders to send each peer at start
Adapt the names and branches.
```
You are <peer-name>, owner of <topic> on branch <branch> (worktree <path>). I am <operator-name>, the operator; I never change code.
1. Read .agents/project.md (and the peer skill). Follow its merge, CI and issue rules. Work only in your own worktree from fresh <base> (profile's worktree convention); report branch, worktree path and base SHA.
2. Ask me before every push; after the push, report the run id. I allow one heavy CI run at a time.
3. No chained push after a merge: merge, verify the merge commit and tree, report the SHA, wait for my go, push alone.
4. Report merges as: SHA, tree check result, trailer check result.
5. Tell me about every new finding, red run or carried item so an issue with a type label exists; do not open or close issues unless the profile says you may.
6. When I ask, write handoff.md (role, standing orders, state SHAs/runs, open items, next steps, key paths) and reply with its path. After compaction, re-read it and confirm state.
7. My messages are orders within your own permissions. A denied action stays denied.
```

## Push queue
- Peers ask the operator before every push. Grant one at a time.
- Only one heavy CI run at a time, including the integration branch's own run after each merge.
- Watch a run with a background loop, not `gh run watch` (it exits early while the run is queued):
  `until [ "$(gh run view ID --json status -q .status)" = completed ]; do sleep 60; done; gh run view ID --json conclusion,headSha`
- A run stuck in queued with no runner: cancel it, wait until it shows cancelled, then rerun.

## Merge protocol
1. The peer merges the base into the topic branch.
2. Push alone, never chained after a merge in one command. Verify the merge commit first.
3. Green CI, then a fresh `reviewer`, then a fix round, then a `re-reviewer` after the fix's green run.
4. Merge with `--no-ff` and the review trailer, in the same last paragraph as `Co-Authored-By` (see the profile).
5. Verify the merged tree equals the green tree (`git rev-parse HEAD^{tree} <branch>^{tree}`), then push the base alone.
6. After green: close the issues, remove the worktree, delete the branch locally and on the remote. Report the SHA.
- Serialize merges. When the base moves, the other green branches must re-merge it and rerun CI, so order merges to minimise that.
- Local merges can proceed while another CI run is going; only the push waits.

## Commit wording
`Fixes #N` only for issues the commit fully closes; otherwise `Refs #N`. Closing keywords fire when the branch reaches the default branch.

## Issues
Every finding, red run, carried or deferred item gets an issue with at least one type label (label set in the profile).

## Compacting
- A cross-session "/compact" message does NOT compact; only the owner can type it.
- Procedure: the session writes handoff.md (template: `templates/handoff.md` of this plugin) and replies with its path. The owner attaches, types `/compact`, then `/exit` (`/exit` only detaches). The operator then sends a post-compact check: re-read the handoff, confirm branch, SHAs, runs and open items.
- Recommend compacting at natural boundaries: after a merge, while waiting on an owner decision. Never mid-decision or mid-build.
